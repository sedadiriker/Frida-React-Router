          Hello, I'm Frida Kahlo, one of the most influential painters of the
          20th century. My art, shaped by Mexican culture and the female
          experience, explores the intersections of reality and imagination with
          a surrealist style. My works reflect my emotional pains and a strong
          feminist perspective. Art has been my sanctuary and means of
          expression through life's challenges. By honoring my body and
          emotions, I give voice to social issues. Preserving my cultural
          heritage and conveying its impact is crucial to me. I hope my art
          contributes to a better world. Thank you for joining me on this
          journey of art and self-discovery.
        </p>
        <p className="finish-title">With love and art... </p>
